# DjangoWeather
This is my first time using Django for webdevelopment. It is a simple web app that shows you your current AQI (Air quality Index) , when you enter the zipcode
of a particular city. 
Currently the website only recongnizes the cities from the US , but I plan on making one for Indian cities as soon as I find a suitable API.
Huge thanks to John Elder(flatplanet) for helping out.
